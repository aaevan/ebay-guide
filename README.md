(or, how I use ebay)

So you want to buy something! Ebay is great but it can be a little tricky finding exactly the thing you want.

As an example item, we'll use one of my favorite objects: **Shure SE215 sound isolating earphones**

First of all, there's pretty much only one object with the string "SE215" in it, so we can trim our query down to that. We can get specific later (condition, color, etc.).

A few questions to start our search:

* Ask, am I willing to wait up to a month and a half for it to get here?
  * If so, it might make sense to buy direct from china through ebay listings or something like aliexpress.
    * Aliexpress has a particularly messy and unpredictable search function so don't try to use any fancy operators like you'll see below.
  * If you're not willing to wait that long,under **Item Location**, make sure to check the box that says, North America. (I'm assuming a US audience).
    * generally, ordering something from somewhere from the continental US will take under a week to get to you.

* How much does your item generally sell for?
  * To get an upper bound, check Amazon and a few other retailers. Amazon tends to be 10 to 20% more expensive than the best deal on ebay. (*citation needed*)
  * For the lower bound, check the "sold listings" box and sort by "Price + Shipping: lowest first

Okay, so we now have an upper and lower bound on the price of the item. Time to start searching.

# A basic search:

# Auctions

If you're willing to be patient, auctions consistently have better prices than Buy It Now listings but it comes at the cost of scheduling 10m out of your life to stare at the last few minutes of a listing.
